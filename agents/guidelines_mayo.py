appendicitis = """
Appendicitis is an inflammation of the appendix. The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch that sticks out from the colon on the lower right side of the belly, also called the abdomen.
Symptoms of appendicitis may include:
- Sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower belly.
- Sudden pain that begins around the belly button and often shifts to the lower right belly.
- Pain that worsens with coughing, walking or making other jarring movements.
- Nausea and vomiting.
- Loss of appetite.
- Low-grade fever that may rise as the illness worsens.
- Constipation or diarrhea.
- Belly bloating.
- Gas.

Tests used to diagnose appendicitis include:
Physical exam. A healthcare professional may apply gentle pressure on the painful area. When the pressure is suddenly released, appendicitis pain will often feel worse. This is because of inflammation of the lining of the abdominal cavity, called the peritoneum.
A care professional also may look for abdominal stiffness and a tendency to flex the abdominal muscles in response to pressure over the inflamed appendix. This is called guarding.
A care professional also may use a lubricated, gloved finger to examine the lower rectum. This is called a digital rectal exam. People of childbearing age may be given a pelvic exam to check for other problems that could be causing the pain.
Blood test. This test checks for a high white blood cell count. A high white blood cell count may mean there's an infection.
Urine test. A urine test, also called a urinalysis, may be done. A urinalysis makes sure that a urinary tract infection or a kidney stone isn't causing the pain.
Imaging tests. Imaging tests may help confirm appendicitis or find other causes for pain. These tests may include an abdominal X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, a CT scan or an MRI.
"""
cholecystitis = """
Cholecystitis (ko-luh-sis-TIE-tis) is swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the belly under the liver. The gallbladder holds fluid that digests food. This fluid is called bile. The gallbladder releases bile into the small intestine.
Symptoms of cholecystitis may include:
- Severe pain in the upper right or center belly area.
- Pain that spreads to the right shoulder or back.
- Tenderness over the belly area when it's touched.
- Nausea.
- Vomiting.
- Fever.

Tests and procedures used to diagnose cholecystitis include:
Blood tests. Blood tests can look for signs of an infection or other gallbladder issues.
Imaging tests that show your gallbladder. Abdominal ultrasound, endoscopic ultrasound, CT scan or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography can make pictures of your gallbladder and bile ducts. These pictures may show signs of cholecystitis or stones in the bile ducts and gallbladder.
A scan that shows the movement of bile through the body. A hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan tracks the making and flow of bile from the liver to the small intestine. A HIDA scan involves putting a radioactive dye into your body. The dye attaches to the cells that make bile. During the scan, the dye can be seen as it travels with the bile through the bile ducts. This can show any blockages.
"""
deverticulitis = """
Diverticulitis is inflammation of irregular bulging pouches in the wall of the large intestine.
A common symptom of diverticulitis is pain in the area below the chest called the abdomen. Most often, pain is in the lower left abdomen.
Pain from diverticulitis is usually sudden and intense. Pain may be mild and gradually worsen, or the intensity of the pain may vary over time.
Other signs and symptoms of diverticulitis may include:
- Nausea.
- Fever.
- Tenderness in the abdomen when touched.
- Changes in stool, including sudden diarrhea or constipation.

During the physical exam, your healthcare professional will gently touch different parts of the abdomen to learn where you have pain or tenderness. An exam also may include a pelvic exam to test for disease of the female reproductive organs.
Laboratory tests may be used to rule out other conditions and make a diagnosis:
Blood tests for signs of infection and immune-system activity.
Urine test.
Stool test.
Pregnancy test.
Liver enzyme test to rule out liver disease.
A computerized tomography (CT) scan can show inflamed diverticula, abscesses, fistulas or other complications.
"""
pancreatitis = """
Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work.
Symptoms of pancreatitis may vary. Acute pancreatitis symptoms may include:
- Pain in the upper belly.
- Pain in the upper belly that radiates to the back.
- Tenderness when touching the belly.
- Fever.
- Rapid pulse.
- Upset stomach.
- Vomiting.
Chronic pancreatitis signs and symptoms include:
- Pain in the upper belly.
- Belly pain that feels worse after eating.
- Losing weight without trying.
- Oily, smelly stools.

Tests and procedures that may be used include the following.
Blood tests can give clues about how the immune system, pancreas and related organs are working.
Ultrasound images can show gallstones in the gallbladder or inflammation of the pancreas.
Computerized tomography (CT) scan show gallstones and the extent of inflammation.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for irregular tissues or structures in the gallbladder, pancreas and bile ducts.
Endoscopic ultrasound is an ultrasound device on a small tube fed through the mouth and into the digestive system. It can show inflammation, gallstones, cancer, and blockages in the pancreatic duct or bile duct.
Stool tests can measure levels of fat that could suggest your digestive system isn't absorbing nutrients as it should.
"""
pericarditis = """
Pericarditis is swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart. This tissue is called the pericardium. Pericarditis often causes sharp chest pain. The chest pain occurs when the irritated layers of the pericardium rub against each other.
Most often, pericarditis pain is felt behind the breastbone or on the left side of the chest. The pain may:
- Spread to the left shoulder and neck, or to both shoulders.
- Get worse when coughing, lying down or taking a deep breath.
- Get better when sitting up or leaning forward.
Other symptoms of pericarditis can include:
- Cough.
- Fatigue or general feeling of weakness or being sick.
- Swelling of the legs or feet.
- Low-grade fever.
- Pounding or racing heartbeat, also called heart palpitations.
- Shortness of breath when lying down.
- Swelling of the belly, also called the abdomen.

Tests to diagnose pericarditis or rule out conditions that may cause similar symptoms may include:
Blood tests. Blood tests usually are done to check for signs of a heart attack, inflammation and infection.
Electrocardiogram (ECG). An electrocardiogram is a quick and painless test that records the electrical signals in the heart. It can show how the heart is beating. Sticky patches called electrodes with wires attach to the chest and sometimes the arms or legs. The wires connect to a monitor, which prints or displays results.
Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray can show changes in the size and shape of the heart. It can tell if the heart is enlarged.
Echocardiogram. Sound waves create images of the moving heart. An echocardiogram shows how well the heart is pumping blood. It also can see any fluid buildup in the tissue surrounding the heart. The test can tell if the sac surrounding the heart affects the way the heart fills with blood or pumps blood.
Cardiac computerized tomography (CT) scan. Cardiac CT scans use X-rays to create images of the heart and chest. The test can be used to look for heart thickening that may be a sign of constrictive pericarditis.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart. A cardiac MRI scan can show thickening, inflammation or other changes in the thin tissue surrounding the heart.
"""
pneumonia = """
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. A variety of organisms, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, can cause pneumonia.
Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:
- Chest pain when you breathe or cough
- Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
- Cough, which may produce phlegm
- Fatigue
- Fever, sweating and shaking chills
- Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)
- Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
- Shortness of breath

If pneumonia is suspected, your doctor may recommend the following tests:
Blood tests. Blood tests are used to confirm an infection and to try to identify the type of organism causing the infection. However, precise identification isn't always possible.
Chest X-ray. This helps your doctor diagnose pneumonia and determine the extent and location of the infection. However, it can't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.
Pulse oximetry. This measures the oxygen level in your blood. Pneumonia can prevent your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream.
Sputum test. A sample of fluid from your lungs (sputum) is taken after a deep cough and analyzed to help pinpoint the cause of the infection.
Your doctor might order additional tests if you're older than age 65, are in the hospital, or have serious symptoms or health conditions. These may include:
CT scan. If your pneumonia isn't clearing as quickly as expected, your doctor may recommend a chest CT scan to obtain a more detailed image of your lungs.
Pleural fluid culture. A fluid sample is taken by putting a needle between your ribs from the pleural area and analyzed to help determine the type of infection.
"""
pulmonary_embolism = """
A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks and stops blood flow to an artery in the lung. In most cases, the blood clot starts in a deep vein in the leg and travels to the lung. Rarely, the clot forms in a vein in another part of the body. When a blood clot forms in one or more of the deep veins in the body, it's called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
Common symptoms include:
- Shortness of breath. This symptom usually appears suddenly. Trouble catching your breath happens even when resting and gets worse with physical activity.
- Chest pain. You may feel like you're having a heart attack. The pain is often sharp and felt when you breathe in deeply. The pain can stop you from being able to take a deep breath. You also may feel it when you cough, bend or lean over.
- Fainting. You may pass out if your heart rate or blood pressure drops suddenly. This is called syncope.
Other symptoms that can occur with pulmonary embolism include:
- A cough that may include bloody or blood-streaked mucus
- Rapid or irregular heartbeat
- Lightheadedness or dizziness
- Excessive sweating
- Fever
- Leg pain or swelling, or both, usually in the back of the lower leg
- Clammy or discolored skin, called cyanosis

Blood tests. Your health care provider may order a blood test for the clot-dissolving substance D dimer. High levels may suggest an increased likelihood of blood clots, although many other factors can cause high D dimer levels.
Chest X-ray. This noninvasive test shows images of your heart and lungs on film. Although X-rays can't diagnose a pulmonary embolism and may even appear fine when a pulmonary embolism exists, they can rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.
Ultrasound. A noninvasive test known as duplex ultrasonography, sometimes called a duplex scan or compression ultrasonography, uses sound waves to scan veins to check for deep vein blood clots. This test can look at veins in the thigh, knee and calf, and sometimes the arms.
CT pulmonary angiography. CT scanning generates X-rays to produce cross-sectional images of your body. CT pulmonary angiography — also called a CT pulmonary embolism study — creates 3D images that can find changes such as a pulmonary embolism within the arteries in your lungs. 
Ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan. When there is a need to avoid radiation exposure or contrast from a CT scan due to a medical condition, a V/Q scan may be done. In this test, a small amount of a radioactive substance called a tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. The tracer maps blood flow, called perfusion, and compares it with the airflow to your lungs, called ventilation. This test can be used to see if blood clots are causing symptoms of pulmonary hypertension.
Pulmonary angiogram. This test provides a clear picture of the blood flow in the arteries of your lungs. It's the most accurate way to diagnose a pulmonary embolism. But because it requires a high degree of skill to perform and has potentially serious risks, it's usually done when other tests fail to provide a definite diagnosis.
MRI. MRI is a medical imaging technique that uses a magnetic field and computer-generated radio waves to create detailed images of the organs and tissues in your body. MRI is usually only done in those who are pregnant — to avoid radiation to the baby — and in people whose kidneys may be harmed by dyes used in other tests.
