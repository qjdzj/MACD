Appendicitis
Clinical Features & Physical Examination: 
- Diagnosis can be challenging; individual clinical variables have low diagnostic value.
- Migratory abdominal pain and signs of peritonitis are important distinguishing features.
Laboratory Tests: 
- Inflammatory markers (e.g., white blood cell count, CRP) are important distinguishing features.
- If two or more inflammatory markers are normal, appendicitis is unlikely; if two or more are elevated, appendicitis is very likely.
- Pediatric patients: White blood cell count (WBC), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis should be routinely checked. CRP ≥10 mg/L and WBC count ≥16,000/mL are strong predictive factors for appendicitis in children.
Clinical Scoring Systems: 
- An Alvarado score <5 is sufficiently sensitive to exclude acute appendicitis.
- The AIR score and AAS score are currently the best-performing clinical prediction scores in adults with suspected acute appendicitis. An AIR score <4 (low probability) has high sensitivity (0.96) for appendicitis and can be used to rule it out.
- Pediatric patients: The Alvarado score and Pediatric Appendicitis Score (PAS) are useful in excluding acute appendicitis. The AIR score has shown the highest discriminating power in children.
Imaging Studies: 
- A combination of ultrasound (US) and clinical scores (e.g., AIR, AAS) may improve diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and potentially reduce the need for CT scans in adults.
- Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is a reliable initial investigation.
- US findings suggestive of appendicitis include: thickened appendiceal wall, non-compressibility, diameter > 6mm, absence of gas in the lumen, appendicolith, hyperechoic periappendiceal fat, fluid collection (abscess), local bowel dilation and hypoperistalsis, free abdominal fluid, and lymphadenopathy. The most sensitive sign is a non-compressible appendix with a diameter > 6mm.
- If a CT scan is required, contrast-enhanced low-dose CT is recommended. The overall sensitivity of CT for diagnosing acute appendicitis is 0.95, and specificity is 0.94.
- Pregnant patients: For suspected appendicitis, graded compression transabdominal US is the preferred initial imaging method. If US is inconclusive, MRI is recommended if available. MRI sensitivity is 90.5%-94%, and specificity is 97%-98.6%.
- Pediatric patients: US is the first-line imaging study. If US is inconclusive, the choice of second-line imaging (e.g., repeat US, CT, MRI) depends on local availability and expertise. MRI can differentiate perforated from non-perforated AA with high specificity.

cholecystitis = """
Cholecystitis
Diagnostic Basis: 
- Diagnosis relies on a combination of detailed history, complete physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging investigations; no single feature is sufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.
- History and Clinical Examination: 
- Fever, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, vomiting, or intolerance to fatty foods.
- Positive Murphy's sign.
Laboratory Tests: 
- Elevated C-reactive protein, elevated white blood cell count.
Imaging Studies: 
- Imaging shows signs suggestive of gallbladder inflammation.
- Abdominal ultrasound is the preferred initial imaging technique; its overall sensitivity for diagnosing acute cholecystitis is 81%, and specificity is 83%.
- Compared to other imaging methods, hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan has the highest sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (sensitivity 84.2%-89.3%, specificity 66.8%-79%).
- CT has poor diagnostic accuracy for acute cholecystitis (sensitivity 59.8%).
- MRI is as accurate as abdominal ultrasound.
"""
diverticulitis = """
Diverticulitis
Clinical Severity: 
- Diverticulitis varies in severity, from uncomplicated phlegmonous diverticulitis to complicated diverticulitis with abscess and/or perforation.
Imaging Studies (CT is crucial for diagnosis and staging): 
- CT imaging is the primary tool for diagnosing and staging ALCD.
- Neff CT Staging (Diagnostic Features): 
- Stage 0 (Uncomplicated): diverticula, wall thickening, increased density of pericolic fat.
- Stage 1: Locally complicated with local abscess.
- Stage 2: Complicated with pelvic abscess.
- Stage 3: Complicated with distant abscess.
- Stage 4: Complicated with other distant complications (e.g., pneumoperitoneum with abundant free fluid).
Ambrosetti CT Classification (Diagnostic Features): 
- Moderate diverticulitis: Localized sigmoid wall thickening (≥5mm) and pericolic fat stranding.
- Severe diverticulitis: Wall thickening accompanied by abscess, or extraluminal gas, or extraluminal contrast.
Kaiser Modified Hinchey Classification (CT Findings): 
- Stage 0: Mild clinical diverticulitis.
- Stage Ia: Confined pericolic inflammation.
- Stage Ib: Confined pericolic abscess.
- Stage 2: Pelvic or distant intra-abdominal abscess.
- Stage 3: Generalized purulent peritonitis.
- Stage 4: Fecal peritonitis at presentation.
Mora Lopez Modified Neff Staging (CT Findings): 
- Stage Ia: Localized pneumoperitoneum (in the form of gas bubbles).
- Stage Ib: Abscess < 4cm.
"""
pancreatitis = """
Pancreatitis
Diagnostic Criteria (at least two of the following three): 
- Abdominal pain consistent with the disease.
- Biochemical evidence of pancreatitis (serum amylase and/or lipase greater than three times the upper limit of normal). The diagnostic cutoff for serum amylase and lipase is normally defined as three times the upper limit of normal.
- Characteristic findings from abdominal imaging.
Laboratory Tests: 
- Serum lipase is considered a more reliable diagnostic marker of AP than serum amylase. (Amylase sensitivity and specificity are 72% and 93%, respectively; lipase 79% and 89%, respectively).
- Trypsinogen-2 dipstick test for AP has a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 94%.
Imaging Studies: 
- Ultrasound should be performed on admission to determine the etiology of acute pancreatitis (e.g., biliary).
- When the diagnosis is uncertain, CT provides good evidence of the presence or absence of pancreatitis, especially to rule out secondary perforation peritonitis or mesenteric ischemia.
- All patients with severe acute pancreatitis need assessment with contrast-enhanced CT (CE-CT) or MRI (optimal timing for the first CE-CT assessment is 72-96 hours after symptom onset). CE-CT can detect peripancreatic necrosis after 72 hours from onset.
- The CT Severity Index (Balthazar score) grades pancreatitis based on the degree of inflammation, presence of fluid collections, and extent of necrosis (Grade A: Normal pancreas; B: Pancreatic enlargement; C: Pancreatic inflammation and/or peripancreatic fat; D: Single peripancreatic fluid collection; E: ≥2 fluid collections and/or retroperitoneal air. Necrosis score is based on the percentage of non-enhancement of the gland).
"""
pericarditis = """
Pericarditis 
Diagnostic Criteria: 
- Pericarditic chest pain: Typically sharp and pleuritic, improved by sitting up and leaning forward.
- Pericardial friction rub: A superficial scratchy or squeaking sound best heard with the diaphragm of the stethoscope over the left sternal border.
- New widespread ST-elevation or PR depression on ECG.
- Pericardial effusion (new or worsening).
Blood Tests: 
- Elevation of markers of inflammation (i.e., C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and white blood cell count).
- Elevation of markers of myocardial injury (i.e., creatine kinase, troponin), especially when myocarditis is present.
Imaging Studies: 
- Electrocardiogram (ECG): New widespread ST-segment elevation or PR depression may be seen in the acute phase.
- Chest X-ray: Generally normal; an increased cardiothoracic ratio only occurs with pericardial effusions exceeding 300 mL. Signs of pleuropericardial involvement may be found.
- Echocardiography: Recommended in all patients with suspected acute pericarditis; it is the first-line imaging test to detect pericardial effusion and its amount, and to assess its hemodynamic impact.
- CT and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR): Can provide evidence of pericardial thickening, effusion, calcification, and pericardial inflammation (e.g., late gadolinium enhancement on CMR).
Other: 
- Systemic signs of infection or inflammation such as fever and leukocytosis may be present.
"""
pneumonia = """
Pneumonia 
Physical Examination: 
- Fever, tachypnea, etc. 
Blood Tests: 
- Abnormal white blood cell count (elevated, or decreased in severe infection).
- Elevated inflammatory markers (e.g., C-reactive protein, procalcitonin), but procalcitonin is not recommended to determine the need for initial antibacterial therapy.
Imaging Studies: 
- Chest X-ray or CT: Confirms the presence of pulmonary infiltrates. (Multilobar infiltrates are a CAP severity criterion ).
Microbiological Tests (for etiological diagnosis, not for diagnosing pneumonia itself): 
- Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions (e.g., sputum, endotracheal aspirates).
- Blood cultures (recommended in specific situations, e.g., severe CAP, or if empirically treating for MRSA or P. aeruginosa ).
- Urinary antigen testing (for S. pneumoniae and Legionella spp., recommended in specific situations, e.g., severe CAP, or if epidemiological factors suggest Legionella ).
- Testing respiratory samples for influenza virus (rapid influenza molecular assay is preferred over rapid influenza diagnostic antigen test).
Other: 
- Respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and pleuritic chest pain may be present [This is a general medical understanding and consistent with "signs and symptoms of pneumonia" ].
- Confusion, hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio ≤250 is a CAP severity criterion ) may be present.
"""
pulmonary_embolism = """
Acute Pulmonary Embolism 
Clinical Features (Non-specific):
- Symptoms: Common symptoms include acute-onset dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, and cough. Others may include haemoptysis, pre-syncope or syncope, and unilateral leg swelling and pain (suggestive of deep vein thrombosis).
- Signs: Common signs include tachypnoea (respiratory rate >20 breaths/min) and tachycardia (heart rate >100 bpm). Others may include signs of deep vein thrombosis (e.g., limb oedema, tenderness) and fever (usually <39°C). The diagnostic process usually combines clinical probability assessment with ancillary tests.
Blood Tests: 
- D-dimer: In patients with low or intermediate clinical probability, a negative D-dimer test helps to exclude pulmonary embolism. It has high sensitivity but low specificity.
Imaging Studies: 
- Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA): The principal imaging test for the diagnosis of PE, directly showing thrombi.
- Lung Scintigraphy (V/Q scan): An alternative imaging test when CTPA is unavailable or contraindicated. A normal V/Q scan excludes PE; a high-probability scan confirms PE.
- Lower Limb Compression Ultrasonography (CUS): Used to detect DVT. In a patient with suspected PE, the detection of DVT by CUS usually confirms venous thromboembolism, and treatment is initiated accordingly.
- Echocardiography: Not a primary diagnostic test for suspected PE. For patients with suspected high-risk PE (with haemodynamic instability), bedside echocardiography showing signs of right ventricular (RV) overload or dysfunction (e.g., RV dilatation, RV free wall hypokinesis, paradoxical septal motion, dilated pulmonary artery, increased tricuspid regurgitation velocity) can support clinical decision-making if CTPA is not immediately available. For non-high-risk patients, it is mainly used for risk stratification.
Electrocardiogram (ECG): 
- The ECG in PE patients is often abnormal but lacks specificity. Possible signs include tachycardia, S₁Q₃T₃ pattern, incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, T-wave inversion in precordial leads (V₁-V₄), and P pulmonale, among other signs of RV strain.
