During a physical examination, a patient may exhibit bradycardia (slow heart rate), irregular heart rhythm, and signs of decreased cardiac output. Laboratory tests may reveal elevated levels of cardiac enzymes, such as troponin, indicating myocardial damage. Imaging, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), may show a complete absence of atrioventricular (AV) conduction, with a dissociation between atrial and ventricular rhythms, confirming the diagnosis of Complete Heart Block.", "C-ANCA positive Vasculitis": "To diagnose C-ANCA positive Vasculitis, consider the following criteria: General symptoms often include systemic manifestations such as fatigue, weight loss, and fever, along with specific organ involvement such as respiratory, renal, or skin manifestations. During a physical examination, patients may exhibit signs of vasculitis, such as palpable purpura, ulcers, or nodules, and may have abnormal lung or kidney findings. Laboratory tests may reveal the presence of C-ANCA antibodies, along with elevated inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies, such as chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan, may show pulmonary infiltrates or nodules, while renal biopsy may demonstrate glomerulonephritis with necrotizing vasculitis.", "Appendiceal Tip Thickening": "To diagnose appendiceal tip thickening, consider the following criteria: General symptoms may include mild to moderate abdominal pain, often localized in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), and occasionally accompanied by low-grade fever or gastrointestinal symptoms. During a physical examination, tenderness or palpable mass may be present in the RLQ. Laboratory tests are usually nonspecific, but may show mild elevation in inflammatory markers such as white blood cell count or C-reactive protein. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), may reveal thickening of the appendiceal tip, indicating possible inflammation or infection.", "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)": "To diagnose Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), consider the following criteria: General symptoms often include fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and recurrent infections. Physical examination may reveal lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or signs of anemia or bleeding. Laboratory tests typically show an elevated lymphocyte count, with a predominance of small mature lymphocytes, and may also indicate anemia or thrombocytopenia. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound, may demonstrate lymph node enlargement or organ infiltration.", "Advanced Dementia": "To diagnose advanced dementia, consider the following criteria: General symptoms typically include severe cognitive decline, marked impairment in memory, language, and executive function, along with significant functional decline and dependence on others for daily activities. During a physical examination, patients may exhibit signs of muscle weakness, gait disturbances, and difficulties with coordination. Laboratory tests may reveal no specific abnormalities, but they are useful in ruling out other potential causes of cognitive decline, such as vitamin deficiencies or thyroid dysfunction. Imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may show significant brain atrophy, particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes, along with the presence of white matter hyperintensities.", "Acute Subdural Hematoma": "To diagnose Acute Subdural Hematoma, consider the following criteria: General symptoms typically include a history of head trauma, followed by a lucid interval and subsequent deterioration in consciousness. Physical examination findings may reveal neurological deficits, such as hemiparesis or pupillary abnormalities. Laboratory tests are not specific for this condition, but may show nonspecific changes, such as anemia or coagulopathy. Imaging, particularly a non-contrast head CT scan, often demonstrates a crescent-shaped or concave hyperdensity overlying the cerebral hemisphere, indicating the presence of a hematoma.", "Gallbladder Necrosis": "To diagnose gallbladder necrosis consider the following criteria: General symptoms typically include severe abdominal pain, often localized to the right upper quadrant (RUQ), accompanied by fever, chills, and jaundice. During a physical examination, a patient might exhibit RUQ tenderness, guarding, and rigidity. Laboratory tests may reveal elevated liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as well as elevated bilirubin levels. Imaging studies, such as ultrasound or computed tomography (CT), may show signs of gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid collection, or gas within the gallbladder wall, indicating necrosis.", "Unstable Angina": "To diagnose unstable angina consider the following criteria: General symptoms typically include chest pain or discomfort that is unpredictable, occurring at rest or with minimal exertion, and lasting longer than 10 minutes. During a physical examination, a patient might exhibit signs of distress, such as diaphoresis (excessive sweating) or shortness of breath. Laboratory tests may reveal elevated cardiac biomarkers, such as troponin, indicating myocardial damage. Imaging, such as an electrocardiogram (ECG), may show ST-segment depression or transient ST-segment elevation, indicating myocardial ischemia."}
